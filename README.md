Biba Technical Test
===================

## What Is This?

This is the Biba technical test. It's for folks who have applied to one of our
developer positions. We've sent this to you because we want to see how you code.

There's no perfect solution to these challenges, so don't worry about having the
most efficient algorithm or smallest memory footprint. We mostly want to see how
you solve a problem, so that we can do a code review in your technical
interview.

In this repo you'll find three folders:

* [`01-grpc-service`](./01-grpc-service)
* [`02-url-shortener`](./02-url-shortener)
* [`03-playgrounds`](./03-playgrounds)

You've only got to do one of the challenges (but there are definitely bonus
points for doing more than one).

There's further details within each folder about what exactly the challenge
involves.

To start, fork this repo -- then get coding!
